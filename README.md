# Repositories 
I have created the CMPG 323-Overview-29029988 Repository at the moment which will house the first project of 4. At this point it is the only necessary repository as other projects have not yet been created.

# Branching Strategy
The Github branching strategy I have decided to utilize is Github Flow as it is the simplest one especially in a small project like this one where i will be working alone. It is also best suited as it has short production cycles which will match up perfectly with the sprints of the project.

# Use of .gitignore file
The use of.gitignore files is to save files that you had previously committed to in your repository but no longer have use for. The usage of this important feature can be used as time goes by because I might learn new features about Github and want to add my work into the repository. However the addition of all these would cause some crowding so this important feature can be used to only show the most prioritized files and commit only those to the repository.

# Storage and Credentials
Github is a public platform and the storage of important information and credentials is not a great idea. Source code repositories were meant to be shared with people/the world. Sometimes people may have to share this source code as they might have to work with groups of people at work or in a team. With the easy access to your source code, anyone having access to your secrets or credentials would be catastrophic.
